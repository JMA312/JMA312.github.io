						<p>Hi! I'm Joseph Ma and I am a Software Engineer, Researcher, and Competitive Programmer!</p>
						<p>8-year-old me got into programming because I liked to play games and what better way to enjoy
							gaming
							than by making some of my own! This got me from putting together hacky pieces of Scratch
							code to the
							slightly-less-hacky Multimedia Fusion Developer 2 to the even-more-so-less-hacky Minecraft
							Plugins
							in Java.</p>
						<p>Now I've gotten the opportunity to work as a Software Engineer at a <a
								href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/entrepreneurship">student-led entrepreneur
								factory</a>,
							<a href="https://www.foodfite.io">a start-up</a>, <a
								href="https://ir.ksyun.com/news-releases/news-release-details/kingsoft-cloud-announces-major-strategic-move-enterprise-cloud">a
								big company</a>, <a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk">and a university</a>! My main interests
							for personal projects nowadays
							focuses on creating accessible products including a Chrome extension that changes fonts to
							be
							larger, dyslexia-friendy, and colorblind-friendly.
						</p>
						<p>In my freetime, I'm starting to get back into competitive programming. I participated (and
							did
							alright) in USA Computing Olympiad (USACO) when I was in highschool, but getting into the
							International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI) seemed absolutely impossible for me and I was a
							bit
							demoralized being the only person at my school to participate. I am now in the <a href="https://www.topcoder.com/members/JMA312">top 30 in the
							US on
							TopCoder</a> and the <a href="https://codeforces.com/profile/JosephMa">top 5 in the UK on CodeForces</a> (these being two of the most well-known and
							popular
							competitive programming sites). Later this year (2022), I plan to participate in in all
							three Google
							Coding Competitions (HashCode, Kickstart, and CodeJam).</p>
						<p>My interests in Software Engineering is mainly backend (though I do enjoy frontend as well!
							I'm
							actually having quite a bit of fun typing this in HTML and styling this with CSS!). I've
							worked with
							most of the common languages such as C/C++, C#, Java, Python, Ruby on Rails, Scala, Clojure,
							Swift,
							etc. and I'm always happy to learn more!</p>
						<p>Outside of programming, I enjoy playing piano, learning languages (currently: English,
							Chinese,
							Spanish, Russian, and Arabic), racing (SCCA licensed), and flying (FAA licensed)!</p>
